# Sprint 1 Kickoff

**Sprint:** 1 (Foundation)  
**Dates:** 2025-12-03 → 2025-12-16  
**Owner:** PM  

## Goal
Deliver the core CRUD foundation and local persistence so users can create, view, edit and delete tasks reliably. Prepare integration points for the AI engine in Sprint 2.

## Sprint Scope (in-sprint priorities)
- Implement Task CRUD UI and services
- IndexedDB persistence integration
- Sorting and basic filtering (due date, priority)
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet
- Unit tests for services and stores

## Ceremonies
- Daily standup: 09:30 local time
- Sprint planning / backlog grooming: Day 0
- Mid-sprint review: Day 6
- Sprint demo & retro: Last day

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria for sprint stories pass
- Unit tests at > 90% for changed modules
- CI build passes on `main` branch
- PRs reviewed and merged

## Risks
- Unexpected IndexedDB edge-cases across browsers
- UI polishing may take extra time; keep scope strict

## Communication
- Channel: `#smart-todo` on team Slack
- Repo: `c:\Users\frode\SG-Slitne`

## Next Steps
1. Developers pick stories from `docs/sprint-1-backlog.md` and create branches
2. Run local dev server and confirm environment
3. Daily check-ins and spike follow-ups if needed
