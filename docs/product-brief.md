# Project Brief: Smart To-Do List with AI Labels

## Vision
Build an intelligent to-do list app that uses AI to automatically suggest labels, priorities, and summaries for tasks, helping users organize and focus with less manual effort.

## Core Features (MVP)
- CRUD for tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- AI-generated labels and priority suggestions
- Automatic task summarization
- Task lists sorted by due date or priority

## Target Users
- Individuals and professionals seeking smarter task management
- Students and freelancers managing multiple projects
- Small teams wanting to share and sync task lists

## Risks & Blockers
- AI accuracy and user trust
- Data privacy and security
- Sync complexity and conflict resolution
- Scope creep beyond MVP

## High-Value Opportunities
- Feedback-driven AI improvement
- Local-first, privacy-preserving AI
- Smart filters and collaboration features
- Integration with calendar/email

## Next Steps
1. Research existing solutions and AI approaches
2. Prototype rule-based label/priority engine
3. Design minimal UI wireframe
4. Draft privacy policy and opt-in flow
5. Plan feedback loop for AI corrections
