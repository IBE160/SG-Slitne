## Case Title
Smart To-Do List with AI Labels


## Background
Many people struggle to organize their daily tasks efficiently. Traditional to-do list apps require users to manually categorize and prioritize each task, which can become time-consuming and inconsistent. With advances in artificial intelligence, it is now possible to automate labeling, prioritization, and task summarization.


## Purpose
The goal of this application is to help users manage their tasks more intelligently by using AI to automatically suggest labels, set priorities, and create short summaries. This reduces cognitive load and helps users focus on what matters most.


## Target Users
- Individuals and professionals who want a simple, intelligent task organizer
- Students or freelancers managing multiple projects
- Small teams who want to share and sync task lists


## Core Functionality


### Must Have (MVP)
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks
- AI-generated labels and priority suggestions for new tasks
- Automatic task summarization
- Task lists sorted by due date or priority


### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- Account login for syncing tasks across devices
- Collaboration and task sharing
- Custom rules for privacy and data retention
- Smart filters (e.g., “Today,” “Urgent,” “Low effort”)


## Data Requirements
- Tasks: title, description, due date, project, notes
- AI Metadata: suggested labels, priority score, summary
- Users (optional): username, email, password (for sync/sharing)


## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to add a new task, so that I can keep track of what I need to do.
2. As a busy professional, I want AI to automatically suggest labels and priorities, so that I can organize faster.
3. As a team member, I want to share task lists with others, so that we can collaborate efficiently.
4. As a privacy-conscious user, I want to choose whether AI can analyze my notes, so that I stay in control of my data.


## Technical Constraints
- Optional authentication (required for sync and sharing)
- Must support CRUD operations on tasks
- Should include a simple AI model (rule-based or classifier) for labeling and summarizing
- Must store data locally, with optional cloud sync
- Should be responsive for both desktop and mobile


## Success Criteria
- Users can create, update, and delete tasks successfully
- AI automatically generates useful labels, priorities, and summaries for tasks
- Application runs smoothly and loads quickly
- (Optional) Tasks sync correctly between devices for logged-in users
