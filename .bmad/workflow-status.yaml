# ============================================================================
# BLOCKER DECISIONS (Must resolve before Phase 2)
# ============================================================================
blockers:
  - id: BLOCKER-001
    title: AI Model Approach
    description: Define whether AI will use heuristic rules or ML classifier
    decision: Heuristic (keyword + rules) - 3-5 days effort
    rationale: MVP speed and simplicity; can upgrade to ML classifier in Phase 2
    impact: HIGH - Determines tech stack, timeline, compute resources
    status: RESOLVED
    resolved_date: 2025-11-30
    owner: architect

  - id: BLOCKER-002
    title: Tech Stack Selection
    description: Choose frontend framework, backend, database, and AI hosting
    decision: Frontend-only (React + IndexedDB) with Node.js API layer for future scalability
    rationale: Fast MVP with local persistence; backend deferred to Phase 2 for sync feature
    impact: HIGH - Affects all downstream architecture and development
    status: RESOLVED
    resolved_date: 2025-11-30
    owner: architect

  - id: BLOCKER-003
    title: Sync Strategy (MVP vs Phase 2)
    description: Decide if cloud sync is MVP or deferred to Phase 2
    decision: Phase 2 - Local-only for MVP, sync deferred
    rationale: Reduces MVP scope and complexity; can add cloud sync after MVP validation
    impact: MEDIUM - Changes success criteria, MVP scope, and timeline
    status: RESOLVED

# DECISION LOG
# ============================================================================
decisions:
  - id: DECISION-001
    date: 2025-11-30
    blocker: BLOCKER-001
    title: AI Model - Heuristic Approach
    rationale: "MVP speed critical. Heuristic rules + keyword extraction achieves MVP in 2-3 weeks. ML classifier deferred to Phase 2."
    
  - id: DECISION-002
    date: 2025-11-30
    blocker: BLOCKER-002
    title: Tech Stack - React + IndexedDB Frontend
    rationale: "Fastest path to MVP. IndexedDB for offline persistence. Node.js API layer prepared for future backend migration."
    
  - id: DECISION-003
    date: 2025-11-30
    blocker: BLOCKER-003
    title: Sync Strategy - Phase 2
    rationale: "MVP validates core value (task capture + AI labels). Sync adds authentication & backend complexity; deferred post-launch."
    
  - id: DECISION-004
    date: 2025-11-30
    title: MVP Success Metrics Updated
    rationale: "Removed sync requirement from MVP success criteria. Focus on local CRUD + AI labeling."

notes: |
  Phase 0 (Analysis & Brainstorming): COMPLETE (2025-11-29)
  Phase 1 (Planning): COMPLETE (2025-11-30)

  PLANNING COMPLETION SUMMARY:
    ✅ PRD validated: PASS (all must-haves mapped, AI strategy aligned, zero gaps)
    ✅ Three epics created with 19 user stories and 83 total story points:
      Epic 1 (Task CRUD): 31 SP, 5 stories
      Epic 2 (AI Engine): 19 SP, 5 stories
      Epic 3 (Sorting/Filtering/UX): 33 SP, 9 stories
    ✅ Sprint 1 ready: 10 user stories (47 SP) covering foundation layer (CRUD, UI, persistence)
    ✅ Critical blockers resolved: Heuristic AI, React + IndexedDB, Phase 2 sync

  NEXT PHASE (Phase 2 - Architecture):
    → UX Design Specification (Wireframes, flows, accessibility)
    → System Architecture Design (Component hierarchy, state management, data flow)
    → Tech Spike: IndexedDB schema validation, Vite build optimization, test setup
    → Sprint 1 Kickoff & Development Start (Sprint timeline: 2 weeks)

  MVP Timeline: 3-4 weeks (Sprints 1-4, post Phase 2 architecture)
  Key Insight: AI heuristic engine (Sprint 2) is critical path for MVP differentiation
